# Deployment Plan - Memory Optimizations

## Current Status
✅ **Already Deployed to Production:**
- Fixed memory reporting (showing actual vs cached memory)
- Real-time monitoring dashboard with WebSocket connection
- Metrics API running on port 3009

❌ **Not Yet Deployed:**
- Memory optimization scripts (ollama-optimize.sh, dynamic-memory-manager.sh)
- Memory optimization dashboard component
- Docker memory limits configuration
- Automated cron jobs for optimization

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Optimization Tools
```bash
# Add optimization scripts
git add advanced-memory-optimizations.sh
git add ollama-optimize.sh
git add dynamic-memory-manager.sh
git add neo4j-memory.conf
git add docker-compose-optimized.yml
git add memory-optimization-report.md

# Commit
git commit -m "feat: Add advanced memory optimization tools and scripts"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy Memory Optimization Dashboard Component
```bash
# Option A: Integrate into main dashboard
# Edit index.html to include memory-optimization-dashboard.js

# Option B: Keep as separate module
git add admin-dashboard-local/memory-optimization-dashboard.js
git commit -m "feat: Add memory optimization monitoring dashboard"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Manual Server-Side Setup Required
Since these are system-level changes, they need manual execution on the VPS:

```bash
# SSH to VPS
ssh root@148.230.93.174

# Run the optimization setup script
./advanced-memory-optimizations.sh

# Verify cron jobs
crontab -l

# Check initial optimization status
/usr/local/bin/dynamic-memory-manager.sh
```

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Decide on optimization dashboard integration**
   - Integrate into main dashboard OR
   - Deploy as separate monitoring page

2. **Commit optimization tools to Git**
   - Currently 22+ uncommitted files
   - Need to organize and commit strategically

3. **Deploy optimization scripts to VPS**
   - Scripts are created locally but not on server
   - Need manual deployment since they're system-level

### Follow-up Actions:
1. **Test optimization effectiveness**
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours
   - Check logs for automation success

2. **Document for team**
   - Update CLAUDE.md with optimization details
   - Create runbook for troubleshooting

3. **Set up monitoring alerts**
   - Configure alerts for high memory usage
   - Set up notifications for optimization failures

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Core Scripts (Today)
1. Commit essential optimization scripts
2. Manually deploy to VPS
3. Verify automation is working

### Phase 2: Dashboard Integration (Tomorrow)
1. Integrate memory optimization dashboard
2. Test full monitoring suite
3. Update documentation

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (This Week)
1. Add error handling to scripts
2. Set up log rotation
3. Configure alerting

## Commands to Execute Now

```bash
# 1. Stage essential files
git add advanced-memory-optimizations.sh memory-optimization-report.md

# 2. Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: Implement advanced memory optimization system

- Add automated Ollama model unloading (30min idle timeout)
- Add dynamic memory manager for container limits
- Configure automated cleanup via cron
- Fix memory reporting to show actual vs cached usage

Reduces idle memory usage by 30-50% through:
- Automatic model unloading
- Dynamic container memory limits
- Regular Docker cleanup
- Neo4j heap optimization"

# 3. Push to deploy
git push origin main
```
