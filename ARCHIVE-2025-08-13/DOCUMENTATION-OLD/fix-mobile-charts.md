# Mobile Charts Fix Summary

## Issue
Charts were not displaying consistently between mobile and desktop views.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated monitoring.js
- Added DOM ready check to ensure charts initialize after page load
- Added explicit canvas visibility settings for all charts
- Added responsive chart options based on screen size
- Added chart reinitialization on window resize
- Added retry mechanism if Chart.js isn't loaded yet

### 2. Updated index.html CSS
- Added explicit display and sizing for canvas elements in mobile view
- Ensured charts are visible with `!important` flags

### 3. Key Improvements
- Charts now adapt to screen size automatically
- Animations disabled on mobile for better performance
- Axes hidden on folded mode to save space
- Thinner lines and smaller elements on mobile

## Deployment Complete
Files have been deployed to the VPS and container restarted.

## Testing Instructions
1. **Desktop**: Visit https://admin.agistaffers.com
2. **Mobile**: Visit same URL on mobile device
3. **Samsung Fold**: Test in both folded and unfolded states
4. **Hard refresh** (Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cache

## Expected Behavior
- All 4 charts (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network) should be visible on both mobile and desktop
- Charts should resize appropriately based on screen size
- Charts should update in real-time with data from the metrics API

## Note
There's a separate `index-fold6.html` file that may be served for Samsung Fold devices. If the main index.html doesn't show charts on Fold devices, this separate file may need to be updated with the monitoring section.
