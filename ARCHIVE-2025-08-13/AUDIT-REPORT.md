# üìä LOCAL FILE AUDIT REPORT
**Date:** August 13, 2025
**Purpose:** Identify what's working vs what needs cleanup

## üü¢ ACTIVE & WORKING FILES

### Core Application
- `agistaffers/` - Main Next.js application
- `CLAUDE.md` - Active project instructions
- `.bmad/` - BMAD methodology (active)
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json` - Dependencies

### Active Deployment Scripts
- Need to identify which deployment script actually works

## üü° NEEDS REVIEW

### Documentation Files (61 total .md files)
**Potentially Keep:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Active instructions
- `allImportant.md` - May contain critical info
- `PORT-CONFIGURATION.md` - Port setup reference

**Old Completion Reports (Consider Archiving):**
- `BMAD-100-PERCENT-COMPLETE.md`
- `SUCCESS-REPORT.md`
- `PROJECT-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md`
- `BMAD-AUTH-COMPLETE.md`
- `BMAD-MULTITENANT-FINAL.md`
- Multiple other completion/success reports

### Disabled/Duplicate Files
- `agistaffers/middleware.ts` (deleted) vs `middleware.ts.disabled`
- `agistaffers/app/globals.css` vs `globals.css.disabled`
- Workbox files: `workbox-e9849328.js` (deleted) vs `workbox-1bb06f5e.js` (new)

### Deployment Scripts
- `deploy-admin-auth.sh`
- `deploy-agistaffers-translations.sh`
- `deploy-correct-local-version.sh`
- `setup-production-env.sh`

## üî¥ LIKELY CLEANUP CANDIDATES

### Cache & Build Files
- `.next/` folder (can be regenerated)
- `node_modules/` (can be reinstalled)
- Old webpack cache files

### Duplicate Auth Implementations
- `agistaffers/app/(auth)/` - Old auth
- `agistaffers/app/admin/login/` - New admin auth
- Need to determine which is active

## üìã RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Move old documentation to DOCUMENTATION-OLD
2. **REVIEW:** Test each deployment script to find the working one
3. **CLEAN:** Remove .next cache after backup
4. **DECIDE:** Which auth implementation to keep
5. **ORGANIZE:** Move experiments and tests to EXPERIMENTS folder

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

1. Which deployment script successfully deploys to production?
2. Is the admin auth at `/admin/login` the correct implementation?
3. Which middleware file should be active?
4. Are the old completion reports needed for reference?
5. Should we keep multiple deployment scripts or consolidate?

## üìÇ FILE CATEGORIES

### Category 1: KEEP ACTIVE
- Files currently in use
- Working deployment scripts
- Active configuration

### Category 2: ARCHIVE FOR REFERENCE
- Old documentation
- Previous success reports
- Legacy deployment scripts

### Category 3: SAFE TO REMOVE
- Cache files (.next)
- Duplicate node_modules
- Old build artifacts

### Category 4: NEEDS DECISION
- Conflicting implementations
- Disabled files
- Multiple versions of same functionality
