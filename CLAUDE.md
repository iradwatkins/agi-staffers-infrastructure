## ‚ö° RULE 8: NO SYSTEM REBUILDS - UPGRADES ONLY
**ABSOLUTE RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- **DO NOT rebuild our current system**
- **ONLY make upgrades to the existing codebase**
- **ENHANCE and IMPROVE what already exists**
- **FORBIDDEN:** Starting from scratch, complete rewrites, architectural rebuilds

**Allowed Actions:**
- ‚úÖ Add new features to existing code
- ‚úÖ Improve existing functionality  
- ‚úÖ Fix bugs and issues
- ‚úÖ Optimize performance
- ‚úÖ Update dependencies
- ‚úÖ Enhance UI/UX

**Forbidden Actions:**
- ‚ùå Rebuild entire system
- ‚ùå Replace existing architecture
- ‚ùå Start new projects from scratch
- ‚ùå Delete and recreate core systems

## ‚ö° RULE 9: NO BACKUPS UNTIL INFRASTRUCTURE 100% COMPLETE
**RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PRIORITY:**
- **NO backup creation until system is fully operational**
- **Backups consume needed space** - defer until infrastructure is complete
- **Focus on getting core infrastructure to 100% first**
- **Backup implementation is END-PHASE work only**

**Current Priority Order:**
1. **FIRST:** Complete infrastructure to 100% operational
2. **SECOND:** Optimize and stabilize all systems  
3. **LAST:** Implement backup systems

**Reasoning:**
- Space conservation for active development
- Resource allocation to critical infrastructure
- Avoid premature optimization
- Complete core functionality before auxiliary systems

**When to implement backups:** Only after infrastructure reaches 100% operational status

## ‚ö° RULE 10: SMART TOOL USAGE - MCP FIRST, DIRECT WHEN EFFICIENT
**TOOL USAGE PRIORITY:**
- **PRIMARY:** Use MCP tools and Cursor extensions as much as possible
- **SECONDARY:** Use direct access when it's easier/more efficient
- **PRINCIPLE:** Choose the most effective method for task completion

**MCP/Extension Priority Examples:**
- Use `git` MCP for version control operations
- Use `filesystem` MCP for complex file operations
- Use `playwright` MCP for testing
- Use `fetch` MCP for API testing

**Direct Access When More Efficient:**
- ‚úÖ Direct GitHub commands if simpler than MCP equivalent
- ‚úÖ Direct Docker commands if more straightforward
- ‚úÖ Direct bash commands for simple operations
- ‚úÖ Native tool access when MCP adds unnecessary complexity

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Speed of execution** - Choose faster method
2. **Simplicity** - Avoid over-engineering simple tasks
3. **Reliability** - Use the most stable approach
4. **Task appropriateness** - Match tool to task complexity

## ‚ö° RULE 11: VAULT PASSWORD MANAGEMENT & TERMINAL ACCESS
**SECURITY & ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALL passwords MUST go in VAULT** - That's why the system was created
- **I have terminal login information and password** - Use when needed
- **I MUST handle terminal commands** - User should NOT do manual terminal work
- **TRY 5 TIMES FIRST** - Only escalate to user after 5 failed attempts

**Password Management:**
- ‚úÖ Store ALL credentials in Vault
- ‚úÖ Retrieve passwords from Vault when needed
- ‚úÖ NEVER hardcode passwords in files
- ‚úÖ Use Vault for all sensitive information

**Terminal Access Protocol:**
1. **USE available terminal access with provided credentials**
2. **ATTEMPT terminal operations up to 5 times**
3. **TROUBLESHOOT and retry different approaches**
4. **ONLY escalate to user after 5 failed attempts**
5. **DOCUMENT what was tried for troubleshooting**

**User Expectation:** I handle all terminal operations unless 5 attempts fail

## ‚ö° RULE 14: PROBLEM-SOLUTION DOCUMENTATION & TRACKING
**MANDATORY PROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCESS:**
- **EVERY problem that occurs MUST be recorded**
- **Solution MUST be documented in markdown format**
- **BEFORE solving new problems:** Check existing problem documentation first
- **PURPOSE:** Make fixing recurring problems quicker and more efficient

**Documentation Format:**
- **Problem Description:** What happened, when, where
- **Error Messages:** Exact error text/codes
- **Solution Steps:** Step-by-step resolution process
- **Prevention:** How to avoid the problem in future
- **Chicago Timestamp:** When problem occurred and was solved

**Storage Location:** `.bmad/docs/problem-solutions/`

**Workflow:**
1. **FIRST:** Search existing problem docs for similar issues
2. **IF FOUND:** Use documented solution
3. **IF NEW:** Document problem and solution after resolving
4. **ALWAYS:** Update docs if solution differs from previous

**Benefit:** Faster problem resolution through knowledge accumulation

## ‚ö° RULE 15: AUTOMATED CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
**AUTOMATED PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:**
- **When we agree to push to production:** All deployment happens automatically
- **NO manual steps** required after agreement to deploy
- **Continuous workflow** from local ‚Üí production
- **Single command execution** handles entire deployment process

**Automated Deployment Flow:**
1. **Agreement:** User confirms "push to production"
2. **Auto-execute:** Run appropriate deployment script automatically
3. **Auto-package:** Create deployment archive from localhost:3000
4. **Auto-transfer:** SCP to VPS (72.60.28.175) automatically  
5. **Auto-deploy:** Extract, install, restart services automatically
6. **Auto-verify:** Confirm deployment success automatically

**Target Scripts:** Use existing deployment scripts like `deploy-correct-local-version.sh`

**Deployment Destination:**

- **Live Sites:** agistaffers.com, admin.agistaffers.com

**User Experience:** Single agreement ‚Üí Complete automated deployment

## ‚ö° RULE 16: MANDATORY BLUE-GREEN DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
**ABSOLUTE DEPLOYMENT METHODOLOGY - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
- **ALL production deployments MUST use blue-green workflow**
- **NO direct deployments to live production allowed**
- **BMAD method REQUIRES this workflow for all deployments**
- **Zero-downtime deployments are MANDATORY**

**THE ASSEMBLY LINE WORKFLOW:**
```
LOCAL (Kitchen/Studio) ‚Üí Continuously developing new code
           ‚Üì
    Deploy to STANDBY (Blue or Green)
           ‚Üì
    Test on STANDBY environment
           ‚Üì
    Switch STANDBY ‚Üí LIVE
           ‚Üì
    Old LIVE becomes next STANDBY
```

**DEPLOYMENT CYCLE - MANDATORY PROCESS:**
1. **IDENTIFY current LIVE environment** (Blue or Green)
2. **DEPLOY new code to STANDBY environment**
3. **TEST thoroughly on STANDBY**
4. **SWITCH traffic from LIVE to STANDBY**
5. **VERIFY new LIVE is working correctly**
6. **Old LIVE becomes next deployment target**

**KEY PRINCIPLES:**
- **LOCAL:** Continuous development (never stops)
- **STANDBY:** Receives latest code from LOCAL
- **LIVE:** Currently serving production traffic
- **Old code is REPLACED, not preserved** - each deployment overwrites

**MANDATORY BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS deploy to the STANDBY environment
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS test before switching
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS maintain two production environments
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use the alternating pattern (Blue‚ÜíGreen‚ÜíBlue‚ÜíGreen)
- ‚ùå NEVER deploy directly to LIVE
- ‚ùå NEVER skip the testing phase
- ‚ùå NEVER break the blue-green cycle

**AUTOMATION REQUIREMENT:**
- Switching process MUST be automated via scripts
- Deployment to STANDBY MUST be automated
- Testing verification MUST be automated where possible
- Manual intervention only for go/no-go decision

**PURPOSE:**
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Instant rollback capability
- Safe production updates
- Continuous delivery pipeline

**This workflow is MANDATORY for all production deployments - NO EXCEPTIONS!**

**I understand and WILL perform these functions exactly as specified.**
